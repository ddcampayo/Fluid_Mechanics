The low Reynolds number is called the creeping, or over-damped
regime. Let us generalize slightly the momentum equation
Eq \ref{eq:NS_usual} to a general volumetric external force $\bff$:
\[
  \rho \frac{d\bfu }{dt} =
  - \nabla p 
  + \mu \nabla^2 \bfu
  + \bff .
\]

We may again cast the equation into reduced form, to get
\[
\rho^* \frac{d\bfu^* }{dt^* } =
-  \nabla^* p^*
+  \frac1{\mathrm{Re}} \nabla^{*2} \bfu^* .
+  \bff^* ,
\]
where $\bff^*= L/(\rho_0 u_0^2) \bff$. 

As $\mathbf{Re}$ is very small, the equation will tend to
\[
0 = - \mathrm{Re} \nabla^* p^* + \nabla^2 \bfu^* + \mathrm{Re} \bff^*
.
\]
All time derivatives are gone from the equation! The only time
variation that is sometimes considered is the case in which $\bff^*$
is a explicit function of time. In this case, the velocity field
adapts instantaneously following the changes in external force. Coming
from previous chapters, devoted to cases where intertial effects are
not negligible, this may come as a surprise --- nevertheless, this is
the correct description of a regime which is important in fields such
as microfluidics and the biological physics of small systems (from
small insects down to large molecules).  Mathematically, the resulting
equation is now linear in the velocity, which makes its treatment
simpler.

An objection could be raised regarding why the pressure gradient and
the external force terms are kept in the equation, despite being
multiplied by the Reynolds number. The answer is that they are not
in fact negligible, as an alternative scaling is employed. This is
discussed in the next section.



\subsection{Kolmogorov flow}

In order to get an idea of the features of the flow (typical speed,
time scale, Reynolds number), we may gain some insight from the
solution from Kolmogorov flow.

This is an exact solution of the momentum equations when there is a
periodic applied force in the $x$ direction that depends on $y$ only
\[
\bff = f_0 \cos\left( \frac{2\pi y}{L} \right) \bfe_x .
\]

In this case, the typical length-scale $L_0$ and velocity $u_0$ are
set by the force. The former is clearly $L_0=L$, but the velocity is
actually part of the solution. It is therefore more convenient to
introduce an alternative way to cast the momentum equation in
non-dimensional form. First, dividing by $f_0$ and going to
dimensionless spacial coordinates:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Navier-Stokes_nondim1}
\frac{\rho}{f_0}
\frac{d \bfu}{d t} =
\frac\mu{f_0 L^2} (\nabla^*)^2 \bfu
-\frac 1{f_0 L} \nabla^* p + \bff^*(\bfr^*) .
\end{equation}
The viscous term sets the velocity scale:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:reduced_u0}
  u_0 = ( f_0 L^2 ) / \mu .
\end{equation}

On the left hand side of \ref{eq:Navier-Stokes_nondim1}, the total
derivative limits the setting of the time scale: $t_0=L/u_0$. This
means the equation may be written as
\[
\frac{\rho L^3 f_0}{\mu^2}
\frac{d \bfu^*}{d t^*} =
(\nabla^*)^2 \bfu^*
-\nabla^* p^* + \bff^*(\bfr^*) ,
\]
or
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Navier-Stokes_nondim2}
\mathrm{Re}
\frac{d \bfu^*}{d t^*} =
(\nabla^*)^2 \bfu^*
-\nabla^* p^* + \bff^*(\bfr^*) ,
\end{equation}
where we again find the Reynolds number, given as
\[
  \mathbf{Re}=\frac{\rho L^3 f_0 }{\mu^2}.
\]
This definition looks rather different from the standard one,
$ \mathbf{Re}=\rho L u_0 / \mu$, but upon insertion of
the typical velocity both are seen to coincide.

Notice that the reduced response time is given by the Reynolds number.
This is a sort of ``double-reduced'' time, given by
$t^{**}= t^* / \mathbf{Re}$. A high Reynolds number therefore means a
long reduced time to respond, while a low Reynolds one the response is
very rapid, and the equilibrium solution is reached very fast. Also,
the pressure is reduced as $p^*= p / ( f_0 L ) $.

Let us apply this scaling to the Kolmogorov flow. Assuming that the
resulting velocity, as the driving force, only has an $x$ component
varying on $y$ (as for planar Couette and Poiseuille flows),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Kolmo_orig}
  \rho \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} =
  \mu \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y^2} - \nabla p +   f_0 \cos(2\pi y/L)  .
\end{equation}

As in previous flow patterns, we may set the pressure to some constant
value. Therefore, in reduced units (dropping the askterisks for
clarity),
\[
  \mathrm{Re} \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} =
  \frac{\partial  u_x}{\partial y^2} u + \cos(2\pi y) .
\]

The solution is easily found:
\[
  u_x = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2} \left( 1-e^{ - (2\pi)^2 t/Re } \right)
  \cos(2\pi y) .
\]

Putting the scales back in, we find
\[
  u = \frac{ f_0 L^2 }{(2\pi)^2 \mu} \left( 1-e^{- (2\pi)^2 \mu t /
      (\rho L^2) } \right) \cos(2\pi y/L) ,
\]
which indeed can be checked to be the solution to the original
Equation \ref{eq:Kolmo_orig}.


\section{General solution}

In Equation \ref{eq:Navier-Stokes_nondim2}, we may disregard
completely the left hand side if the Reynolds number is very low. This
leads to Stokes' equation \index{Stokes' equation}:
%, which in dimensionless units is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Stokes}
  \mu \nabla^2 \bfu -\nabla p = - \bff(\bfr) .
\end{equation}
As mentioned, this is a \emph{linear} equation for the velocity.  We
may get a general solution to the equation that gives us the velocity
field for any external field, by using Fourier techniques.

In Fourier space all the fields are given as \index{Fourier transform}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:F_r_to_q}
  \phi_\bfq &=                    \int d\bfr \, \phi(\bfr) e^{-i\bfq\cdot\bfr}  \\
  \label{eq:F_q_to_r}
  \phi(\bfr) &= \frac 1{(2\pi)^d}  \int d\bfq \, \phi_\bfq e^{ i\bfq\cdot\bfr} .
\end{align}
We follow the convention that is usual in physics, in which Fourier
components are indicated by an index --- also, no tilde (``wiggly'')
hat is used for them for simplicity. Thus, $ \phi_\bfq $ instead of
$ \tilde{\phi}(\bfq) $.

Stokes' equation for Cartesian coordinate $i$ reads
\cite{bray2002theory}
\[
-\mu q^2 \bfu_{\bfq,i} - i \bfq_i p_\bfq = - \bff_{\bfq,i} ,
\]
or
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_Fourier0}
\bfu_{\bfq,i} = \frac 1{\mu q^2}
\left[
  - i \bfq_i p_\bfq + \bff_{\bfq,i} 
\right] .
\end{equation}

Now, the pressure is fixed by incompressibility. The condition
$\nabla\cdot\bfu=0$, reads in Fourier space
\[
  \sum_i\bfq_i\cdot\bfu_{\bfq,i} .
\]
Multiplying Equation \ref{eq:u_Fourier0} by $\bfq_i$ and adding up the
$d$ equations:
\[
\sum_i \bfq_i \bfu_{\bfq,i} = \frac 1{\mu q^2}
\left[
  - i q^2 p_\bfq + q_i\bff_{\bfq,i} 
\right] =0 .
\]

Therefore,
\[
  - q^2 p_\bfq = i q_i\bff_{\bfq,i}   .
\]
This looks like the Fourier version of a Poisson pressure equation:
\[
  \nabla^2 p = \nabla\cdot \bff .
\]
This is no coincidence, since in \ref{eq:Stokes} we may use the
identity
\(\nabla^2 \bfu = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\bfu -
\nabla\times\nabla\times\bfu \). The first term must be zero for an
incompressible fluid, and applying $\nabla\cdot$ we may get rid of the
first one too (since a rotational field is divergence free). The
Poisson equation results. It is interesting that much the same
equation is found in computational methods that enforce
incompressibility by projection.

The pressure is then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_Fourier0}
p_\bfq = -i \frac{\sum_i q_i\bff_{\bfq,i} }{q^2} .
\end{equation}

With this result we may write Equation \ref{eq:u_Fourier0} as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_sol_Fourier}
\bfu_{\bfq,i} = \frac 1{\mu q^2}
\sum_j
\left[ \delta_{ij} - \frac{ \bfq_i  \bfq_j}{q^2} \right]
\bff_{\bfq,j} =: \sum_j T_{ij} \bff_{\bfq,j},
\end{equation}
%
where the last equation the Oseen tensor is defined:
\[
T_{\bfq,ij} := \frac 1{\eta q^2} \left[
  \delta_{ij} - \frac{ \bfq_i  \bfq_j}{q^2} 
\right].
\]

In 3D, Equation \ref{eq:p_Fourier0} may be inverted back to real space
to yield \cite{pozrikidis2011introduction}.
\[
p(\bfr) = \frac{\bff\cdot\bfr}{4\pi r^3} .
\]

Oseen's tensor can also be inverted:
\[
T_{ij}(\bfr) :=  \frac 1{8\pi \eta r} 
\left(
  \delta_{ij} + \frac{ \bfr_i  \bfr_j}{r^2}
\right)
\]
But notice Equation \ref{eq:u_sol_Fourier} is a convolution in
real space:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u_sol_real}
\bfu_i(\bfr) =  \sum_j \int \,d\bfr' T_{ij}(\bfr'-\bfr) \bff_j(\bfr') .
\end{equation}

In 2D, on the other hand, the Fourier expressions cannot be
inverted. This is the famous ``Stokes paradox''\index{Stokes
  paradox''}: there are no solutions to his equation for steady
translational motion in 2D (it also applies to 2D problems in 3D, such
as the motion of an infinite cylinder).

\section{Creeping flow past a sphere}

Unfortunately, the creeping flow past a cylinder cannot be solved, due
to Stokes paradox. This may have been anticipated by dimensional
analysis. Indeed, the drag force on a sphere of radius $R$ is expected
to be given by
\[
  D \sim \mu u_0 R ,
\]
which has the right combination of units to yield a net force. It also
makes sense, being proportional to the viscosity, velocity, and
radius. (One may have expected $R^2$, the projected area, but this
does not work dimensionally.) It is indeed correct, a fact that will
be proved in this section, together with the missing numerical
prefactor.

If we write something similar for the drag force on a cylinder, the
answer should come as a force per length in the perpendicular
direction (as e.g. the lift for our cylinder with circulation of
\ref{sec:}). I.e.
\[
  \frac{D}{R} \sim \mu u_0 .
\]
But this makes no sense, since all dependence on $R$ is lost --- and
there is not clear candidate to provide another length parameter.

To solve this problem, we begin with the Stokes equation with no
forces:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Stokes}
  \mu \nabla^2 \bfu -\nabla p = 0 .
\end{equation}

We may intruduce the vorticity $\vort=\nabla\times\bfu$, and recall
the expression for the curl of the curl used previously,
Eq. \ref{eq:curl_of_curl},
%
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla \times \vort =
  \nabla (\nabla \cdot \bfu )-\nabla^{2} \bfu .
\end{equation*}

The first term is null due to incompressibility. Hence,
\[
\mu \nabla \times \vort = - \nabla p.
\]
If we take the divergence of this expression we find that the pressure
is harmonic:
\[
  \nabla^2 p = 0
\]

If, on the other hand, we take the curl, we find
\[
  \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \vort \right)= 0
\]
This is again, the curl of a curl, so Eq. \ref{eq:curl_of_curl} may be
again used:
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \vort \right)=
  \nabla (\nabla \cdot \vort )-\nabla^{2}\vort .
\end{equation*}
But the vorticity is always divergence-free, it being the curl of
another field. Therefore vorticity is also harmonic!:
\[
  \nabla^2 \vort = 0 .
\]

Our method of solution will make use of the stream
function. Introducing our vector potential of
Eq. \ref{eq:vector_potential}
\[
  \vort = \nabla \times ( \nabla \times \bfA ) .
\]
Using, for the third time,  Eq. \ref{eq:curl_of_curl},
\[
  \vort =   \nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf {A} )-\nabla^2\bfA .
\]
If we make sure $\bfA$ is divergence-free, then
\[
  \nabla^2 \left( \nabla^2\bfA \right) = 0 \implies
  \nabla^4 \bfA  = 0 .
\]
The operator $\nabla^4$ is called the bi-harmonic operator, or
bi-Laplacian. \index{bi-Laplacian}

This is a daunting equation, but we may make use of our experience
when dealing with potential axysimmetric problems in spherical
coordinates. Once again, the vector potential will be purely
azimuthal, and related with the stream function $\psi$ as in
\ref{eq:Stokes_stream_spherical}.

The identity of Eq. \ref{eq:psi_eq_from_A} leads to an equation
of the form:
\[
  \nabla^2\bfA = \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} {\cal L} \psi  \bhe_\phi ,
\]
where the operator $\cal L$ is defined as
\[
  {\cal L} :=
  \frac{\partial^2  }{\partial r^2} +
  \frac{1}{r^2} \left[
    \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial \theta^2} - 
    \cot(\theta) \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}
  \right] .
\]

Now, something very interesting happens: this result is relatively
simple due to the way $\psi$ and $\bfA$ are related in
\ref{eq:Stokes_stream_spherical}, in particular
$\frac{\psi}{r \sin\theta}$ being the only component, purely
azimuthal, and dependent on $r$ and $\theta$.  But, our result for
$\nabla^2\bfA$ complies with this very same conditions!  This means,
that by defining the function $g:=  {\cal L} \psi $, we get
\[
  \nabla^2\bfA := \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} g(r,\theta) \bhe_\phi ,
\]
and we know the result of another application of the Laplacian is
going to be
\[
  \nabla^2( \nabla^2\bfA) = \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} {\cal L} g  \bhe_\phi ,
\]
or
\[
  \nabla^4\bfA = \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} {\cal L}^2 \psi \bhe_\phi .
\]
Then, the bi-Laplacian equation for $\bfA$ translates into
\[
  {\cal L}^2 \psi = 0.
\]

This still looks quite impressive, but it turns out that simple
separation of variables yields the answer. First, our boundary
conditions must be
\[
  \psi(r \to \infty ,\theta) \to \frac12 u_0 r^2 \sin^2\theta
  \qquad
  \left.\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right|_{r=R} =
  \left.\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right|_{r=R} = 0
\]
The first one reproduces the correct uniform field in the $z$
direction away from the sphere (see the potential stream function,
Eq. \ref{eq:potential_sphere_stream}.) The other two are no-slip
boundary conditions at the sphere surface.

Let us try this simple ansatz: $\psi=f(r) \sin^2\theta$. Moreover, let
us find out which power-laws satisfy the bi-Laplacian equation by
exploring $f(r) \sim r^a$.

If we try $\psi=r^2 \sin^2\theta$ we find
\[
  {\cal L} \psi = \left[ a(a-1) - 2 \right] r^{a-2} \sin^2\theta ,
\]
so the possible exponent values for ${\cal L} \psi = 0$ are $a=2$ and
$a=-1$ (this basically solves the potential flow problem.)

Notice that, once again, the outcome contains a function that is very
similar to the input. This means that, applying twice the differential
operator we will get
\[
  {\cal L}^2 \psi =
  \left[   a  (a-1) - 2 \right]
  \left[ (a-2)(a-3) - 2 \right]
  r^{a-4} \sin^2\theta ,
\]
so  the possible exponent values for ${\cal L}^2 \psi = 0$ are $a=2$ and
$a=-1$, as before, plus $a=4$ and $a=1$.

The solution we try will be a combination of all four posibilities --- but
the $a=4$ we can discard right away because it is too high a divergence. Let
us write
\[
  \psi = u_0 \left[ \frac12 r^2 + \frac{A}{r} + B r \right] \sin^2\theta .
\]
Then our boundary conditions at $r=R$ imply
\begin{align*}
  \left.\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right|_{r=R} = 0 &\implies
                                                            R-\frac{A}{R^2} + B  =0 \\
  \left.\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta}\right|_{r=R} = 0 &\implies
                                                            \frac12 R^2-\frac{A}{R} + BR  =0 ,
\end{align*}
from which we may obtain $A$ and $B$, and finally write the solution
\[
  \psi = \frac12 u_0 R^2
  \left[\left(  \frac{r}{R} \right)^2
    + \frac12 \frac{R}{r} - \frac32 \frac{r}{R} \right] \sin^2\theta .
\]
The components of the velocity are readily found from
\ref{eq:u_from_psi_spherical},
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    u_r     &=  u_0  \left[
      1+ \frac12 \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^3 - \frac32 \frac{R}{r}
    \right] \cos \theta \\
    u_\theta &=
    - u_0  \left[
      1
      - \frac14 \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^3 - \frac34 \frac{R}{r}
    \right] \sin \theta
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

The pressure is found from \ref{eq:}, and found to have a simple expression,
\[
  p=p_0 - \frac32 \frac{\mu u_0}{R} \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2
  \cos\theta ,
\]
where $p_0$ is the pressure far from the sphere. Notice this pressure
is harmonic, as discussed above. At the sphere surface,
\[
  p(r=R) = p_0 - \frac32 \frac{\mu u_0}{R} \cos\theta,
\]
with a high-pressure zone at the fore of the sphere (the point facing
the upstream direction, $\theta=\pi$), and a lower pressure at the aft
($\theta=0$). This clearly asymmetric pressure distribution results in
a net drag on the sphere
\[
  D_p=  - \int_S  p \cos\theta dA =
  -2\pi R^2 \int_0^\pi d\theta \sin\theta  p(\theta) \cos\theta =
  + 3 \pi \mu u_0 R \int_0^\pi d\theta \sin\theta  \cos^2\theta .
\]
The minus sign comes from the fact that we want the pressure upon the
sphere, which by reaction is opposite the pressure upon the fluid.
The last integral is immediate: the primitive is $-(1/3)\cos^3\theta$,
so the definite integral provides a $2/3$ factor. Finally,
\[
  D_p=  2 \pi \mu u_0 R .
\]
This agrees with our guess of \ref{eq:drag_sphere_guess}.

However, this drag force is due to pressure only. There will be an
additiona shear drag, which may be calculated from the shear stress.
The relevant component of the tensor is (see \cite{white1991viscous},
Eq. B17, p. 584):
\[
  \tau_{r\theta} = \mu \left(
    \frac1r
    \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} +
    r \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left( \frac{u_\theta}{r}\right) 
  \right) .
\]

This can be computed to obtain
\[
  \tau_{r\theta} = 
  - \frac32 \frac{\mu u_0}{r} \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^3 \sin\theta ,
\]
hence at the sphere surface,
\[
  \tau_{r\theta} (r=R) =  - \frac32 \frac{\mu u_0}{R}  \sin\theta .
\]
This looks very similar to the pressure, with a $\sin$ instead of a
$\cos$, which means the stress is maximal at the equator, which seems
reasonable. However, the contribution to the drag force is higher ---
twice higher, to be precise. Indeed,
\[
  D_\tau =  - \int_S  \tau_{r\theta} \sin\theta dA ,
\]
with a minus sign for the same reason as the pressure, and a $\sin$
because this is a shear stress, resulting in a force that is
tangential to the surface of the sphere.  Then
\[
  D_\tau =
  - 2\pi R^2 \int_0^\pi d\theta   \tau_{r\theta} \sin^2\theta  =
  3 \pi \mu u_0 R  \int_0^\pi d\theta \sin^3\theta .
\]
The primitive of $\sin^3\theta$ is, through
$\cos^2\theta=1-\sin^2\theta$, equal to
$(1/3) \cos^3\theta - \cos\theta$. The definite integral is then $4/3$, and
\[
  D_\tau = 4 \pi \mu u_0 R .
\]

The final drag force is the celebrated Stokes drag law: \index{Stokes drag law}
\[
  D_\tau = 6 \pi \mu u_0 R ,
\]
where $1/3$ of the drag is due to pressure and $2/3$ to shear stress.

Despite the shear having a contribution that is twice that two
pressure, notice that by writing 
\begin{align*}
  - p(r=R) + p_0 &= \bar{p} \cos\theta,  
  -\tau_{r\theta} (r=R) &= \bar{p} \sin\theta,  
\end{align*}
where $\bar{p} := - (3/2) \frac{\mu u_0}{R}$, it is apparent that the
normal force, due to pressure, and the tangential one, due to shear
stress, result from a decomposition of a force upon the sphere surface:
\[
  \bff := \frac32 \frac{\mu u_0}{R} \bhe_z .
\]
It is remarkable that this force is equal for every point on the
sphere.




FOR POTENTIAL.TEX:




In axisymmetric flow,
\[
  \divu =
  {1 \over r^2}{\partial \left( r^2 u_r \right) \over  \partial r} +
  {1 \over r\sin\theta}{\partial \over \partial  \theta} \left( u_\theta\sin\theta \right) ,
\]
but an equivalent expression is
\[
  \divu =
  {\partial \left( r^2 u_r \sin\theta \right) \over  \partial r} +
  {\partial \left( r u_\theta\sin\theta \right)  \over \partial  \theta}
\]

so continuity is trivially satisfied with the choice
\ref{eq:u_from_psi_spherical}.


From the curl in spherical coordinates,
\begin{align}
  u_r     &= \frac {1}{r\sin \theta }
            \frac{ \left( \partial A  \sin \theta \right) }{\partial \theta }  \\
  u_\theta &= -\frac1{r} \frac{\partial (rA) }{\partial r} 
\end{align}
and we find
\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:u_from_psi_spherical}
  \begin{split}
    u_r     &=  \frac1{r^2 \sin\theta} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} \\
    u_\theta &= -\frac1{r   \sin\theta} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}



Notice $A=\psi / \rho $ also in spherical coordinates !
