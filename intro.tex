\chapter*{Introduction}

Just a compilation of notes on different aspects of fluid
dynamics I have collected over the years.

The final push was from teaching the course Fluid Dynamics on the
International Master of Nuclear Fusion, course 2018. I realized much
material was scattered all over the place, on notes, articles, blog
entries \ldots

I may upload these notes to a collaborative site (e.g. github) so that
other people may contribute. As of today, I am the sole author.\\[4cm]
