A book with notes on fluid mechanics


Just a compilation of notes on different aspects of fluid
dynamics I have collected over the years.

The final push was from teaching the course Fluid Dynamics on the
International Master of Nuclear Fusion, course 2018. I realized much
material was scattered all over the place, on notes, articles, blog
entries...

I am uploading to github so that
other people may contribute. As of today, I am the sole author
