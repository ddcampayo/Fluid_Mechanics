\section{The concept of particle}

In these notes, we will be dealing with ``particles'' \index{particle}
quite a lot. This is because fluid dynamics are part of what is called
continuum mechanics, in which bodies are supposed to be continuous in
a mathematical sense. By this me mean, we can pieces of any material
as small as we want. 


\section{The continuity equation}
\label{sec:continuity}

Let us consider a particle that is cubic in shape, with one of their
corners at the origin and the three incident adges aligned with the
Cartesian coordinates. This choice is completely general, given our
freedom in defining a particle (as long as we make it ininitesimally
small at the end), and in origin and axes for coordinates.

There may be a mass influx though the left face of the particle due
to advection (i.e. the existence of a velocity field). For a small
time $dt$, it will be given by
\[
\left. d m \right|_\text{l} =
\rho ( u_x \, dt) \, dy\, dz .
\]
Indeed, all the fluid material that a distance $\delta= u_x \, dt$
away, or closer, will pass through the surface. The whole mass influx
is therefore $\rho$ times $\delta dA$, where $dA=dy dz$ is the cross-
sectional area. (Since the particle is cubic, $dx=dy=dz$, but it is
clearer to use different symbols.)

At the right wall, the mass change will be negative (if $v_x$ is positive
there):
\[
\left. d m \right|_\text{r} =
 -  \rho' ( u'_x \, dt) \, dy\, dz .
\]

The mass change due to the horizontal component of the velocity field is
therefore
\[
\left. d m \right|_x =
  \left[  \rho'  u'_x -  \rho  u_x \right] \, dt \, dy\, dz .
\]

Notice that we have allowed for the possibility that the combination
$\rho u_x$ may be somewhat different at the left and right
walls. Indeed, if they were equal, there would be no net mass change,
since the mass that enters would equal that leaving. Nevertheless,
since $dx$ is small, we may approximate the value at the right
wall in a Taylor series:
\[
\rho'  u'_x \approx  \rho  u_x  +
\frac{\partial  \rho  u_x}{\partial x} dx .
\]
Therefore,
\[
\left. d m \right|_x \approx
-\frac{\partial  \rho  u_x}{\partial x} \, dt \, dx \, dy\, dz .
\]
Or,
\[
\frac1V \left. \frac{d m}{d t} \right|_x \approx
-\frac{\partial  \rho  u_x}{\partial x}
\]

Since $dm/V=\rho$, the density of the particle, we may write, in the
limit of $dt\to 0$,
\[
\left. \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \right|_x =
-\frac{\partial  \rho  u_x}{\partial x} .
\]

Notice the usage of the $\partial$ symbol: since the particle is
fixed, with matter entering and leaving, this is the correct
symbol. This is an ``Eulerian'' point of view --- a complementary,
``Lagrangian'' view of the particle as moving with the flow will be
discussed in \ref{sec:continuity2}.

In order to get the total rate of change in density, we have to
add up the other two directions. In doing so, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:continuity0}
  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} =
  -\frac{\partial  \rho  u_x}{\partial x
    -\frac{\partial  \rho  u_y}{\partial y}
    -\frac{\partial  \rho  u_z}{\partial z}  =
    -\nabla\cdot ( \rho  \bfu) .
\end{equation}
In the last equation the divergence of field $ \rho \bfu$ is
seen to appear naturally.

This is the correct expression, which is usually written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:continuity}
  \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +  \nabla \cdot (\rho \bfu ) = 0 .
\end{equation}


A more direct procedure to get it involves integrals, rather
than differentials.

By definition, mass is the integral of the density:
\[
d m = \int_V \rho d\bfr
\]
However, a mass flux $\rho\bfu$ may cause changes in it:
\[
d m = - \oint_{\partial V} \rho \bfu \cdot \bfn dS ,
\]
where $\partial V$ is the surface around volume $V$. The minus sign
appears because the surface normal, $\bfn$ points from the inside
toward the outside of the surface. We may transform the latter
integral into a volume integral from Gauss' theorem:
\[
d m = - \int_V \nabla\cdot (\rho \bfu ) dV .
\]
Equating both changes,
\[
\int_V \rho d\bfr = - \int_V \nabla\cdot (\rho \bfu ) dV .
\]
Since the identity is valid for any volume $V$, the integrands may
be equal. This fact leads to the same expression as before.


\subsection{Incompressibility}

By ``incompressible'' it is usually meant that variations in $\rho$
(spatial or temporal) are negligible. Continuity then readily implies:
\[
\nabla \cdot  \bfu  = 0 ,
\]
I.e., the velocity field must be divergence-free --- another adjective
is ``solenoidal'', as an analogy with the magnetic field. The latter,
as no magnetic charges (``monopoles'') have ever been seen, satisfies
this equation.

A technical issue is incompressibility is often defined as $\nabla
\cdot \bfu = 0 $. This does \emph{not} imply that $\rho$ is constant,
even though its reverse is true. Indeed, in this case:
\[
\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +  \nabla \cdot (\rho \bfu ) =
\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +   \bfu \cdot \nabla \rho
+ \rho \underbrace{\nabla \cdot \bfu}_{=0} = 0
\]

\[
\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +   \bfu \cdot \nabla \rho = 0 .
\]

As will be discussed in \ref{sec:continuity2}, this means that the
total (or ``convective'') time derivative of $\rho$ is zero. This
implies that $\rho$ is constant at every moving particle, or along
streamlines.
